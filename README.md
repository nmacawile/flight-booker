# Project: Fly me there

## What is this project?
It is a dummy app designed to help the users find and book one-way flights to almost anywhere around the globe. The flights here were generated randomly and do not reflect real world data. The data on the international airports were scraped from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_airports_by_country).

## Purpose of this project
This app makes use of some complicated data structures. It necessary to use the advanced form fields to represent the data properly in the front-end. 
The student will have lots of practice dealing with nested forms and dropdown menus while building this project.
